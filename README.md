ChickenCoop
===========

This coop has a covered and fully screened footprint of ~ 6ft x 13 ft; the actual coop/house is 6ft x 8ft. This size coop can comfortably host 8-12 chicken, assuming the hens also have regular access to a larger run ([4 sq ft per chicken is a common rule](http://www.backyardchickens.com/t/34001/coop-and-run-sq-feet-per-chicken)].
